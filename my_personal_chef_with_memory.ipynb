      "\n",
      "1) Sheet-pan Sausage with Roasted Veggies\n",
      "- Uses: sausage, bell peppers, carrots, broccoli (and olive oil, salt, pepper you probably have)\n",
      "- Why it works: a simple one-pan meal that uses the sausage and a colorful mix of veggies.\n",
      "- How it goes: Preheat oven to about 425°F. Slice the peppers and carrots, cut broccoli into florets, slice sausage. Toss with oil, salt, pepper, and optional garlic or Italian seasoning. Spread on a sheet pan and roast 20–25 minutes, tossing once. Finish with a little grated cheese if you like.\n",
      "\n",
      "Source ideas for this approach: “One Pan Roasted Vegetables and Sausage” and “Sausage and Vegetable Sheet Pan Dinner” on common cooking sites.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Shakshuka with Peppers and Tomatoes\n",
      "- Uses: eggs, bell peppers, tomatoes (you may have some in the fridge)\n",
      "- Why it works: a hearty, comforting breakfast-for-dinner that uses peppers and eggs; you can skip or swap onions/garlic if you don’t have them.\n",
      "- How it goes: Sauté chopped peppers (and onion if you have it) in olive oil until soft. Add chopped tomatoes (or a can of tomatoes if you have it) and simmer to sauce thickness. Make four wells and crack in eggs. Cover until eggs are set to your liking. Serve with bread or toast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Source ideas for this approach: shakshuka recipes from The Mediterranean Dish, Love & Lemons, or Tori Avey.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Cheesy Veggie Omelette or Frittata\n",
      "- Uses: eggs, peppers, broccoli, tomatoes, cheese\n",
      "- Why it works: quick, flexible, great for using up a variety of veggies and cheese.\n",
      "- How it goes: Sauté chopped peppers and broccoli (and tomatoes if you want). Beat eggs with a splash of milk, salt, and pepper. Pour over veggies, sprinkle cheese on top, cook on the stove until set, or finish under the broiler for a frittata.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Sausage & Pepper Stuffed Peppers (or Pepper Fry with Sausage)\n",
      "- Uses: bell peppers, sausage, cheese\n",
      "- Why it works: a tasty stuffed-vegetable option that’s easy to customize.\n",
      "- How it goes: Slice the tops off 4 bell peppers and remove seeds. Mix cooked sausage (crumbled) with some cheese and diced tomatoes (optional). Stuff peppers and bake at 375°F until peppers are tender and the filling is heated through. Top with a little extra cheese if you like.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bonus quick tip if you have pasta or rice in your pantry: toss any of the above veggies and sausage with cooked pasta or rice, add tomato or cheese sauce, and finish with herbs/cheese for a fast “sausage and veggie” skillet.\n",
